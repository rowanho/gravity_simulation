# Gravity Simulation

A multibody simulation using Euler's method. Some of the code (step 4 and 6) is parallelised with openmp.
The report shows a scaling analysis of step 4 as the number of cores is increased.

Parallelised code was evaluated using Hamilton, Durham university's high performance computing cluster.
